# Remarks 
Meta Platforms recently announced that it posed record revenue in its fourth quarter earnings. The record quarter was aided by artificial-intelligence improvements in its ad business. Earlier in the week, it had announced plans to increase spending on AI and estimated that its capital-expenditures for 2025 would be roughly 70% over 2024 projections. This announcement comes in the wake of numerous other companies such as Apple also announcing increases in spending to develop data centers and AI software. Meta's earnings also comes after chinese AI company DeepSeek showcased a high performing model at a fraction of the cost. What I found most interesting is seeing how these big tech companies will respond afer DeepSeek's model showed that you can develop sophisticated models at a low cost. Before, there was a consensus that more complex models could only be developed with more chips and more money spent. Now, DeepSeek has shown that this is not the case and that you should work smarter not harder.  

Shaurya Srivastava -  I agree on how you discussed that DeepSeek has now the potential to be truly disruptive in the AI space. Given their achievements finanically, it will be interesting to see how other players in the AI space, such as Meta, would respond. I think that things in the AI space are now going to largely change.
